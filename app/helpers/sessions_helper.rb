  # Logging out involves undoing the effects of the log_in method.
  # One way to do this would be to use the sessionâ€™s delete method to remove just the user id:
  #          session.delete(:user_id)
  # This would work in our case because the only current session variable is session[:user_id], 
  # but an even better technique is to use the reset_session method to ensure that
  # all session variables are reset upon logging out.
  def log_out
    reset_session
    @current_user = nil
